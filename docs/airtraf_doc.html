            This option allows you to scan the all the channels for available 
            access points. It is necessary to do a preliminary scan before selecting 
            an access point to monitor. This is also the interface to a continuous 
            scan, which will reveal any access points within range of the sensor.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>C</strong>hange Selected Target AP<br>
            This enables you to select one of the available access points (as 
            discovered in a scan) to monitor. You will be automatically prompted 
            to select a access on exiting from the scan channels interface. This 
            selection also allows you to clear the target access point which is 
            necessary before loading a capture session.<br>

            passing over the network broken down along several discrete axes such 
            as type of frame (management, control, data) and by transmitting node.

            TCP <strong>P</strong>erformance Analysis<br>
            Display specific information concerning about a connected node. Select 
            a node and show details on the type, bandwidth, and statistics of 
            its TCP connections.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>B</strong>egin Capture Process<br>
            Allows you to capture monitoring data to a file in order to be reviewed 
            at your leisure. Capture process allows you to set the sample rate 
            in order to exert fine grain control over the size of the capture 
            file.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>E</strong>nd Capture Process<br>

            <br>
            <strong>L</strong>oad Capture File<br>
            Load a previously captured session into memory, allowing you to play, 
            rewind and fast forward through the data in each of the possible data 
            windows. <br>
            <br>
